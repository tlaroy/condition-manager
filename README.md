# midi-critical-fumble
Critical and Fumble Tables for Foundry VTT.

A work in progress ...

* Requires: Foundry (0.7.9).
* Requires: dnd5e system (1.2.0).
* Requires: Midi-QOL module (0.3.39).
* Optional for Animated Rolls: Dice so Nice module (3.2.1).
* Optional for Apply Results: Combat Utility Belt module (1.3.8).

When a critical or fumble attack roll is made an additional d20 is roll made. The additional roll determines the critical or fumble results. Results are displayed and optionally conditions are applied.

This module provides a Condition Manager which allows for full programmatic access to Conditions from within macros. Included is an Examples macro which demonstrates usage.
